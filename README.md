Cross 6 - Final boss, level layout and game ending

At the end of the level the player will encounter a boss that will start a dialogue. When the boss is defeated the game will go into the ending and the player will win the game. The world of the game was made to be more than just a room, it is actually a world that the player has to run around and find platforms, enemies and power-ups.

When the player walks into the final area of the game after traversing through the newly developed map, the player will interact with a final boss and fight against them. After the player manages to beat the final boss the final screen for winning the game will be displayed.

In the next update certain actions for enemy and players will have sound effects along with background music. Dialogue boxes will be added to make gameplay easier.
